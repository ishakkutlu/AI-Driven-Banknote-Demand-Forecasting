# AI-Driven Banknote Demand Forecasting System at the Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye

This repository presents the development of the Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye’s first AI-based forecasting system—a high-impact prototype trained and validated on real-world data across 48 models to predict national and regional banknote demand.

This project encompasses a hybrid modeling approach combining machine learning (FNN, LSTM, TLNN) and time series analysis (SARIMA) to forecast banknote demand across six denominations and two geographic levels. The system achieved up to 99% accuracy (SMAPE) and supports strategic cash distribution planning.

## Key Highlights
- Developed 48 models covering national and regional levels.
- Achieved up to 99% accuracy using SMAPE metric.
- Implemented early stopping, loss monitoring, and data normalization.
- Conducted comparative analysis between AI models and SARIMA.
- Utilized Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pmdarima, Statsmodels, Matplotlib.

## Implementation
To explore the project in detail, including 12 distinct datasets and 14 Jupyter notebooks used for training and forecasting AI and time series models with national and regional data, please visit the Kaggle repository:
