# Forecasting the Banknote Demand of the Economy with Artificial Intelligence Technologies and Time Series Analysis: A Comparison of Türkiye-Wide and Eskişehir Branch Rediscount Region
Implemented various artificial neural networks including MLP, TLNN and LSTM and SARIMA model of time series forecasting techniques on 12 diverse data sets to predict in the banknote demand of the economy within the scope of my published professional qualification thesis. Concluded that there is no single great model to apply to all problems. Deputy Dean of Engineering Faculty at the Eskişehir Technical University, Assoc. Prof. Emre Çimen has also proposed to turn the thesis into an article and publish it in an international journal.

In the project, by artificial intelligence technologies and time series analysis models, it is aimed to forecast the banknote demands of the economy for one-year periods at the general and regional level. The project includes theory and practice related to artificial neural networks and time series. In the implementation phase, used Turkey-wide and Eskişehir Branch data, consisting of 12 different data sets, and performing the training and forecastings of ANN and time series models through 15 different notebooks by means of Python librararies such as tensorflow, keras, numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, math, statistics, statsmodels, pmdarima and random.
