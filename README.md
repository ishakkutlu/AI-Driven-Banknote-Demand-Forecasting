# Forecasting the Banknote Demand of the Economy with Artificial Intelligence Technologies and Time Series Analysis: A Comparison of Türkiye-Wide and Eskişehir Branch Rediscount Region

Spearheaded and developed 48 AI-driven models to forecast national and regional banknote demand, improving planning and distribution efficiency. Achieved high accuracy in predictions by applying machine learning and time series techniques.

## Key Highlights:

- Achieved up to 99% accuracy in national and regional forecasts
- Improved supply management efficiency by 30%
- Reduced operational costs through effective demand forecasting
- Integrated various AI models for robust forecasting:
  * Feed Forward Neural Network (FNN) / Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
  * Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
  * Time Lagged Neural Network (TLNN)
  * Seasonal Integrated Autoregressive Moving Average (SARIMA)
- Conducted analysis using Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pmdarima, Statsmodels, Matplotlib


## AI-Driven Banknote Demand Forecasting at CBRT: Expertise and Insights
Explored and implemented advanced forecasting techniques for national and regional banknote demand at the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT). This expertise, detailed in my published thesis, includes high-accuracy models and innovative methodologies. The thesis provides an in-depth analysis of the theories and techniques applied, showcasing the impact on planning and distribution efficiency.

## Implementation

In the implementation phase, used Turkey-wide and Eskişehir Branch data, consisting of 12 different data sets, and performing the training and forecastings of ANN and time series models through 15 different Python notebooks:
